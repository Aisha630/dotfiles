# üñ•Ô∏è My Custom Terminal Configuration

This repository houses my personalized terminal setup, encompassing Zsh shell configurations, Kitty terminal emulator settings, Neofetch system information display customizations, and a bespoke Oh My Posh theme. The objective is to achieve a harmonious blend of aesthetics, functionality, and performance for an optimized terminal experience.

To bring this config to any ssh session, we can utilize [xxh](https://github.com/xxh/xxh.git).

## üéØ Why Zsh?

[Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) (Z shell) is a powerful and highly customizable Unix shell that offers advanced features such as:

- Command auto-completion
- Syntax highlighting
- History search
- Enhanced scripting capabilities

I chose Zsh for its flexibility and modern features, making it an excellent choice for developers and power users.

## üöÄ Journey to the Current Setup

### Initial Setup: Oh My Zsh

Initially, I used [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), a popular open-source framework for managing Zsh configurations. Oh My Zsh provides a wide array of themes and plugins that enhance the terminal experience. Some key benefits of Oh My Zsh:

- Easy installation and management of plugins
- A large community with extensive resources
- Pre-configured themes for aesthetics and productivity

#### Why I Removed Oh My Zsh

While Oh My Zsh is great, I found it to be **too heavy** for my needs. Specifically:

1. **Slow Terminal Startup**: Oh My Zsh added noticeable delays to the terminal startup time.
2. **Redundant Features**: Many of its features were overkill for my use case, and I wanted a leaner setup.

---

### Extracting Essential Plugins

Before removing Oh My Zsh, I identified certain plugins that were invaluable for my workflow. For example:

- **`copyfile`**: A plugin for quickly copying file paths to the clipboard.
- **`copypath`**: A plugin for copying directory paths to the clipboard.

I manually copied these plugins into my custom plugins folder (`~/.zsh/plugins/`) and ensured they worked independently.

For these two plugins, I had to change the `clipcopy` command in their respective `.zsh` files to `pbcopy` for my Mac.

---

### Current Setup: Lean and Fast

After removing Oh My Zsh, I designed my `.zshrc` to include only the necessary plugins and features:

- Direct sourcing of plugins from a custom `~/.zsh/plugins/` directory
- Optimized aliases for frequently used commands
- Integration with tools like `fzf`, `neofetch`, and `oh-my-posh`

The result? **A terminal that is significantly faster without compromising on functionality.**

## üîß Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zsh-config.git
   cd zsh-config
   ```
2. Back up your existing `.zshrc`:

   ```bash
   mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.backup
   ```
3. Link the custom `.zshrc`:

   ```bash
   ln -s $(pwd)/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
   ```
4. (Optional) Customize the `ZDOTDIR` if you want to store the configuration in a custom directory:

   ```bash
   export ZDOTDIR=/path/to/this/repo
   ```
5. Restart Zsh or source the `.zshrc`:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Variables

#### Environment

- `HISTORY_SUBSTRING_SEARCH_HIGHLIGHT_FOUND`: Customizes the highlight color for history substring matches.

## What is `.zprofile`?

The `.zprofile` file is executed during the **login** phase of a Zsh shell session. This makes it ideal for setting environment variables and configurations that need to be available globally, even when scripts or non-interactive shell sessions run.

In contrast to `.zshrc`, which is executed for **interactive** shells, `.zprofile` is best suited for login-specific setups.

#### How I Use `.zprofile`

In this configuration, `.zprofile` is used to set:

- **Environment Variables**: Global paths and variables that need to be consistent across sessions.
- **Initialization Commands**: Commands that should run only once when the shell starts as a login shell.
- **Custom `ZDOTDIR`**: Redirects Zsh to use a custom directory for its configuration files.

#### Example `.zprofile`:

```zsh
# Set ZDOTDIR to use a custom configuration directory
export ZDOTDIR="$HOME/.config/zsh"

# Add custom paths
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

# Initialize environment variables for tools like Homebrew
if [ -x /opt/homebrew/bin/brew ]; then
  eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
fi

# Set default editor
export EDITOR="nvim"

# Load the .zshrc explicitly
source "$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc"
```

#### Why Use `.zprofile`?

1. **Environment Setup**: Variables like `PATH`, `EDITOR`, or `LANG` are set once and globally.
2. **Compatibility**: Ensures non-interactive or script sessions also have the necessary environment variables.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps login-related configurations distinct from interactive shell settings.

#### Why Separate `.zprofile` and `.zshrc`?

Keeping `.zprofile` and `.zshrc` separate allows for cleaner and more maintainable configurations:

- **`.zprofile`**: Global setup for login shells, environment variables, and system-wide commands.
- **`.zshrc`**: Interactive shell configurations, such as aliases, functions, and prompts.

This separation ensures that login-only settings do not clutter the interactive session configuration and vice versa.

## **Oh My Posh**

[Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) is a powerful and highly customizable prompt theme engine that works with various shells, including Zsh, Bash, and PowerShell. It enables you to create stunning and functional terminal prompts, incorporating useful information like Git status, system stats, virtual environments, and more.
