# üñ•Ô∏è My Custom Terminal Configuration

This repository houses my personalized terminal setup, encompassing Zsh shell configurations, Kitty terminal emulator settings, Neofetch system information display customizations, LSD (LSDeluxe) configurations, and a custom Oh My Posh theme. The objective is to achieve a harmonious blend of aesthetics, functionality, and performance for an optimized terminal experience.

## Dotfiles Management with GNU Stow

I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage my dotfiles. This repository is what I upload to GitHub, and I manually use `stow` to symlink the configuration directories and files into my home directory (e.g., `~/.config`, `/.zshrc` etc).

**Example usage:**

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
stow .
```

This approach keeps my home directory clean and makes it easy to update or remove configurations.

If you want to use this method, make sure you have `stow` installed (`brew install stow` on macOS).

To bring this config to any ssh session, we can utilize [xxh](https://github.com/xxh/xxh)

The easiest way to set up this configuration is using the provided installation script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The install script will:

- Detect your operating system and package manager
- Install Zsh (if not already installed)
- Install required tools: `lsd`, `fzf`, `zoxide`, `bat`, `kitty`, `neofetch`, `oh-my-posh`
- Install and configure Zsh plugins
- Offer to set Zsh as your default shell

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation, see the [detailed installation section](#-installation) below.

## Why Zsh?

[Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) (Z shell) is a powerful and highly customizable Unix shell that offers advanced features such as:

- Command auto-completion
- Syntax highlighting
- History search
- Enhanced scripting capabilities

I chose Zsh for its flexibility and modern features, making it an excellent choice for developers and power users.

## Journey to the Current Setup

### Initial Setup: Oh My Zsh

Initially, I used [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), a popular open-source framework for managing Zsh configurations. Oh My Zsh provides a wide array of themes and plugins that enhance the terminal experience. Some key benefits of Oh My Zsh:

- Easy installation and management of plugins
- A large community with extensive resources
- Pre-configured themes for aesthetics and productivity

#### Why I Removed Oh My Zsh

While Oh My Zsh is great, I found it to be **too heavy** for my needs. Specifically:

1. **Slow Terminal Startup**: Oh My Zsh added noticeable delays to the terminal startup time.
2. **Redundant Features**: Many of its features were overkill for my use case, and I wanted a leaner setup.

---

### Current Setup: Lean and Fast

After removing Oh My Zsh, I designed my `.zshrc` to include only the necessary plugins and features:

- Direct sourcing of plugins from a custom `~/.zsh/plugins/` directory
- Optimized aliases for frequently used commands
- Integration with tools like `fzf`, `neofetch`, and `oh-my-posh`

The result? **A terminal that is significantly faster without compromising on functionality.**

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Variables

#### Environment

- `HISTORY_SUBSTRING_SEARCH_HIGHLIGHT_FOUND`: Customizes the highlight color for history substring matches.

## What is `.zprofile`?

The `.zprofile` file is executed during the **login** phase of a Zsh shell session. This makes it ideal for setting environment variables and configurations that need to be available globally, even when scripts or non-interactive shell sessions run.

In contrast to `.zshrc`, which is executed for **interactive** shells, `.zprofile` is best suited for login-specific setups.

#### How I Use `.zprofile`

In this configuration, `.zprofile` is used to set:

- **Environment Variables**: Global paths and variables that need to be consistent across sessions.
- **Initialization Commands**: Commands that should run only once when the shell starts as a login shell.
- **Custom `ZDOTDIR`**: Redirects Zsh to use a custom directory for its configuration files.

#### Example `.zprofile`:

```zsh
# Set ZDOTDIR to use a custom configuration directory
export ZDOTDIR="$HOME/.config/zsh"

# Add custom paths
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

# Initialize environment variables for tools like Homebrew
if [ -x /opt/homebrew/bin/brew ]; then
  eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
fi

# Set default editor
export EDITOR="nvim"

# Load the .zshrc explicitly
source "$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc"
```

#### Why Use `.zprofile`?

1. **Environment Setup**: Variables like `PATH`, `EDITOR`, or `LANG` are set once and globally.
2. **Compatibility**: Ensures non-interactive or script sessions also have the necessary environment variables.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps login-related configurations distinct from interactive shell settings.

#### Why Separate `.zprofile` and `.zshrc`?

Keeping `.zprofile` and `.zshrc` separate allows for cleaner and more maintainable configurations:

- **`.zprofile`**: Global setup for login shells, environment variables, and system-wide commands.
- **`.zshrc`**: Interactive shell configurations, such as aliases, functions, and prompts.

This separation ensures that login-only settings do not clutter the interactive session configuration and vice versa.

### Installation Logs

The automated installer creates logs at `~/.zsh_install.log` for debugging failed installations.
